    "Homework should be submitted through Gradescope. \n",
    "\n",
    "All answers should be fully motivated, with logically complete arguments and motivations. No late homework will be accepted. \n",
    "\n",
    "All submitted homework must be written up individually without consulting anyone else’s written solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission of homework that require coding needs to be fully commented, the inputs and and outputs (text and/or figures) clearly explained. Both the correctness of the code and the clarity of comments will contribute to the grade you receive. Often the commenting is more extensive than the code itself. You should discuss the outputs of your code, critically and as needed in order to answer specific questions in the problems, so that the questions are fully answered. Outputs without comments/discussion will not be counted.\n",
